### Moving Average Types – Comparison Table

| Moving Average | Full Name                            | Calculation Style                            | Strengths                                      | Weaknesses                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **SMA**        | Simple Moving Average                  | Equal weight to all periods                   | Stable, smooth                                 | Very slow to react to trend changes             |
| **EMA**        | Exponential Moving Average             | More weight on recent candles                 | Faster signals, trend-friendly                  | More false signals in ranging markets           |
| **WMA**        | Weighted Moving Average                | Linear increasing weight to newer data        | Smoother & faster than SMA                      | Sensitive to noise                              |
| **HMA**        | Hull Moving Average                    | Uses WMA + smoothing techniques               | Extremely smooth & very fast                    | Can repaint on lower timeframes (visual)        |
| **DEMA**       | Double Exponential Moving Average       | 2×EMA smoothing                               | Faster than EMA                                 | Can overshoot price                              |
| **TEMA**       | Triple Exponential Moving Average       | 3×EMA smoothing                               | Very fast and smooth                             | Can give overly early signals                    |
| **LR Curve**   | Linear Regression Curve                 | Statistical line fitted to price              | Best for trend direction analysis               | Not ideal for short-term signaling              |
